conv1_feature_maps_64FilterActivationMaps.png shows the activation maps of passing 64 different filters with a conv2d layer. This is the first layer so the incoming channels are the 3 RGB channels and the convolution is mapping it to 64 channels by using 64 different filters. 
Refer to 'class ResNet(nn.module)' for reference on full details of the architecture in https://pytorch.org/vision/0.8/_modules/torchvision/models/resnet.html
